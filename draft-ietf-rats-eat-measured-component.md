--- abstract

The term "measured component" refers to an object within the attester's target environment whose state can be sampled and typically digested using a cryptographic hash function.
Examples of measured components include firmware stored in flash memory, software loaded into memory at start time, data stored in a file system, or values in a CPU register.
This document provides the information model for the "measured component" and two associated data models.
This separation is intentional: the JSON and CBOR serializations, coupled with the media types and associated Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) Content-Formats, enable the immediate use of the semantics within the Entity Attestation Token (EAT) framework.
Meanwhile, the information model can be reused in future specifications to provide additional serializations, for example, using ASN.1.

# Introduction

{{Section 4.2.16 of -rats-eat}} defines a `Measurements` claim that:

{: quote}
> [c]ontains descriptions, lists, evidence or measurements of the software that exists on the entity or any other measurable subsystem of the entity

This claim allows for different measurement formats, each identified by a different CoAP Content-Format ({{Section 12.3 of -coap}}).
Currently, the only specified format is Concise Software Identification (CoSWID) Tags of type "evidence", as per {{Section 2.9.4 of -coswid}}.
However, CoSWID is not suitable for measurements that cannot be anchored to a file system, such as those in early boot environments.
To address this gap, this document introduces a "measured component" format that can be used with the EAT `Measurements` claim alongside or instead of CoSWID.

The term "measured component" refers to an object within the attester's target environment whose state can be sampled and typically digested using a cryptographic hash function.
This includes, for example: the invariant part of a firmware component that is loaded in memory at startup time, a run-time integrity check (RTIC), a file system object, or a CPU register.

This document provides the information model for the "measured component" and two associated data models {{-models}}.
This separation is intentional: the JSON and CBOR serializations, coupled with the media types and associated CoAP Content-Formats, enable the immediate use of the semantics within the EAT framework.
Meanwhile, the information model can be reused in future specifications to provide additional serializations, for example, using ASN.1. This approach is consistent with the guidance in {{Section 5.2 of ?I-D.ietf-opsawg-rfc5706bis}}.

# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

In this document, CDDL {{-cddl}} {{-cddlplus}} {{-cddlctls}} is used to describe the data formats.
This specification uses the following CDDL control operators: `.b64u` defined in {{Section 2.1 of -cddlctls}}, `.json` defined in {{Section 2.4 of -cddlctls}}, and `.cbor` defined in {{Section 3.8.4 of -cddl}}.

Examples are folded following the conventions in {{RFC8792}}.

# Information Model {#measured-component}

This section presents the information model of a "measured component".

A "measured component" information element includes the component's sampled state (in digested or raw form) along with metadata that helps in identifying the component.
Optionally, any entities responsible for signing the installed component can also be specified.

The information elements (IEs) that constitute a "measured component" are described in {{tab-mc-info-elems}}.

| IE | Description | Requirement Level |
|----|-------------|-------------------|
| Component Name | The name given to the measured component. It is important that this name remains consistent across different releases to allow for better tracking of the same measured item across updates. When combined with a consistent versioning scheme, it enables better signalling from the appraisal procedure to the relying parties. | REQUIRED |
| Component Version | A value representing the specific release or development version of the measured component.  Using Semantic Versioning {{SEMVER}} is RECOMMENDED. | OPTIONAL |
| Digested or Raw Value | Either the raw value or the digested value of the measured component. | REQUIRED |
| Digest Algorithm | Hash algorithm used to compute the Digest Value. | REQUIRED only if the value is in the digested form |
| Authorities | One or more entities that can authoritatively identify the component being measured. | OPTIONAL |
{: #tab-mc-info-elems title="Measured Component Information Elements"}

A data model implementing this information model SHOULD allow a limited amount of extensibility to accommodate profile-specific semantics.

# Data Models

This section presents coordinated JSON and CBOR data models, each of which implements the information model outlined in {{measured-component}}.

The data model is inspired by the "PSA software component" claim ({{Section 4.4.1 of -psa-token}}), which has been refactored to take into account the recommendations about the design of new EAT claims described in {{Appendix E of -rats-eat}}.

CDDL is used to express rules and constraints of the data model for both JSON and CBOR.
These rules must be strictly followed when creating or validating "measured component" data items.
When there is variation between CBOR and JSON, the CDDL generic `JC<>`, defined in {{Appendix D of -rats-eat}}, is used.

## Common Types

The following three basic types are used at various places within the measured component data model:

~~~ cddl
{::include cddl/common-types.cddl}
~~~

## The `digest` Type {#digest}

A digest represents the result of a hashing operation together with the hash algorithm used.
The type of the digest algorithm identifier can be either `int` or `text` and is interpreted according to the {{!IANA.named-information}} registry.
Specifically, `int` values are matched against "ID" entries and `text` values are matched against "Hash Name String" entries.
Whenever possible, using the `int` encoding is RECOMMENDED.

~~~ cddl
{::include cddl/digest.cddl}
~~~

## The `measured-component` Data Item

The `measured-component` data item is as follows:

~~~ cddl
{::include cddl/mc.cddl}

{::include cddl/labels.cddl}
~~~

The members of the `measured-component` CBOR map / JSON object are:

{:vspace}
`"id"` (index 1):
: The measured component identifier encoded according to the format described in {{component-id}}.

`"measurement"`:
: Either a digest value and digest algorithm (index 2), encoded using the digest format ({{digest}}), or the "raw" measurement (index 5), encoded as a byte string.
Note that, while the size of the digested form is constrained by the digest function, the size of the raw form can vary greatly depending on what is being measured (it could be a CPU register or an entire configuration blob, for example).
Therefore, a decoder implementation may decide to limit the amount of memory it allocates to this specific field.

`"authorities"` (index 3):
: One or more authorities, see {{authority}}.

`"flags"` (index 4):
: a 64-bit field with profile-defined semantics, see {{profile-flags}}.

### Component Identifier {#component-id}

The `component-id` data item is as follows:

~~~ cddl
{::include cddl/component-id.cddl}
~~~
{:vspace}

`name`
: A string that provides a human readable identifier for the component in question.  Format and adopted conventions depend on the component type.

`version`
: A compound `version` data item that reuses the encoding and semantics of {{-rats-eat}} `sw-version-type`, extending it to non-software components.
(Note that the complete definition of `sw-version-type` depends on the `$version-scheme` CDDL socket defined in {{Section 2.2 of -coswid}}.)

### Authority Identifier {#authority}

An authority is an entity that can authoritatively identify a given component by digitally signing it.
This signature is typically verified during installation ({{Section 7 of -suit-arch}}), or when the measured component is executed by the boot firmware, operating system, or application launcher, as in the case of Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) Secure Boot {{UEFI2}} and Arm Trusted Board Boot {{TBBR-CLIENT}}.
Another example may be the controlling entity in an app store.
Note that this signature is in no way related to the attester's signature on the EAT-formatted evidence.
By extension, an authority identifier does not, by itself, indicate the signer of the enclosing EAT-formatted evidence.

An authority is identified by its signing public key.
It could be an X.509 certificate, a raw public key, a public key thumbprint, or some other identifier that can be uniquely associated with the signing entity.
In some cases, multiple parties may need to sign a component to indicate their endorsement or approval.
This could include roles such as a firmware update system, fleet owner, or third-party auditor.
The specific purpose of each signature may depend on the deployment, and the order of authorities within the array could indicate meaning.

If an EAT profile ({{Section 6 of -rats-eat}}) uses measured components, it MUST specify whether the `authorities` field is used.
If it is used, the profile MUST also specify what each of the entries in the `authorities` array represents, and how to interpret the corresponding `authority-id-type`.

The `authority-id-type` is defined as follows:

~~~ cddl
{::include cddl/authority.cddl}
~~~

### Profile-specific Flags {#profile-flags}

This optional field can contain up to 64 bits of profile-defined semantics, enabling a profile of this specification to encode additional information and extend the base type.
It can be used to carry information in fixed-size chunks, such as a bit mask or a single value within a predetermined set of codepoints.
Regardless of its internal structure, the size of this field is exactly 8 bytes.

The `flags-type` is defined as follows:

~~~ cddl
{::include cddl/profile-flags.cddl}
~~~

If an EAT profile ({{Section 6 of -rats-eat}}) uses measured components, it MUST specify whether the `flags` field is used.
If it is used, the profile MUST also specify how to interpret the 64 bits.

## EAT `measurements-format` Extensions

The CDDL in {{fig-eat-plug}} extends the `$measurements-body-cbor` and `$measurements-body-json` EAT sockets to add support for `measured-component`s to the `Measurements` claim.

~~~ cddl
{::include cddl/eat-plug.cddl}
~~~
{: #fig-eat-plug title="EAT measurements-format Extensions"}

Each socket is extended with two new types: a "homogeneous" representation that is used when `measured-component` and the EAT have the same serialization (e.g., they are both CBOR), and a "tunnel" representation that is used when the serializations differ.

## `measurements-format` for CBOR EAT

The entries in {{tab-mf-cbor}} are the allowed `content-type` / `content-format` pairs when the `measured-component` is carried in a CBOR EAT.

Note the use of the "homogeneous" and "tunnel" formats from {{fig-eat-plug}}, and how the associated CoAP Content-Format is used to describe the original serialization.

| `content-type` (CoAP C-F equivalent) | `content-format` |
|--|--|
| `application/measured-component+cbor` | `mc-cbor` |
| `application/measured-component+json` | `mc-json` |
{: #tab-mf-cbor title="measurement-format for EAT CWT"}

## `measurements-format` for JSON EAT

{{tab-mf-json}} is the equivalent of {{tab-mf-cbor}} for JSON-serialized EAT.

| `content-type` (CoAP C-F equivalent) | `content-format` |
|--|--|
| `application/measured-component+json` | `mc-json` |
| `application/measured-component+cbor` | `tstr .b64u mc-cbor` |
{: #tab-mf-json title="measurement-format for EAT JWT"}

## EAT Profiles and Measured Components

The semantics of the `authorities` and profile `flags` fields are defined by the applicable EAT profile, i.e., the profile of the wrapping EAT.

If the profile of the EAT is not known to the consumer and one or more Measured Components within that EAT include `authorities` and/or profile `flags`, the consumer MUST reject the EAT.

## Examples

The example in {{ex-1}} is a digested measured component with all the fields populated.

~~~ cbor-edn
{::include cddl/ex1.diag}
~~~
{: #ex-1 title="Complete Measured Component"}

The example depicted in {{ex-eat-1}} is the same measured component as above but used as the format of a `measurements` claim in an EAT claims-set.

This example uses TBD1 as the `content-type` value of the `measurements-format` entry.

[^rfced] Please change TBD1 to the value assigned by IANA to the `measured-component+cbor` Content-Format.

Note that the array contains only one measured component, but additional entries could be added if the measured Trusted Compute Base (TCB) is made of multiple, individually measured components.

~~~ cbor-edn
{::include cddl/eat-ex1.diag.in}
~~~
{: #ex-eat-1 title="EAT Measurements Claim using a Measured Component (CBOR)"}

The example in {{ex-eat-2}} illustrates the inclusion of a JSON measured component inside a JSON EAT.

This example uses TBD2 as the `content-type` value of the `measurements-format` entry.

[^rfced] Please change TBD2 to the value assigned by IANA to the `measured-component+cbor` Content-Format.

~~~ cbor-edn
{::include-fold cddl/eat-ex1-json.diag.in}
~~~
{: #ex-eat-2 title="EAT Measurements Claim using a Measured Component (JSON)"}

The example shown in {{ex-2}} is a measured component representing a boot loader identified by its path name:

~~~ cbor-edn
{::include cddl/ex2.diag}
~~~
{: #ex-2 title="Digested Measured Component using File Path as Identifier"}

The example in {{ex-3}} is a raw measured component.

~~~ cbor-edn
{::include cddl/ex3.diag}
~~~
{: #ex-3 title="Raw Measured Component"}

# Security Considerations {#seccons}

The considerations discussed in {{Sections 9.1 (Claim Trustworthiness), 9.4 (Multiple EAT Consumers) and 9.5 (Detached EAT Bundle Digest Security Considerations) of -rats-eat}} apply to this document as well.
Note that similar security considerations may apply when the Measured Component information model is serialized using different data models than the ones specified in this document.

The Component Name and Component Version can give an attacker detailed information about the software running on a device and its configuration settings.
This information could offer an attacker valuable insight.

Any textual fields (e.g., Component Name and Component Version) that are stored in a file, inserted into a database, or displayed to humans must be properly sanitized to prevent attacks and undesirable behavior.
Further discussion and references on this topic can be found in {{Section 7 of -unicode-subsets}}.

If the component measurement is digested, the digest must be computed using a strong cryptographic hash function.

# Privacy Considerations {#privcons}

The differential encryption considerations discussed in {{Section 9.1 (Multiple EAT Consumers) of -rats-eat}} also apply to this document.

The Component Name and Component Version may reveal private information about a device and its owner.

Additionally, the stability requirement of the Component Name may enable tracking.

# IANA Considerations

[^rfced] replace "{{&SELF}}" with the RFC number assigned to this document.
