--- abstract

A measured component is a measurable object of an attester's target environment, that is, an object whose state can be sampled and digested.
Examples of measured components include the invariant part of firmware that is loaded in memory at startup time, a run-time integrity check, a file system object, or a CPU register.

This document defines a "measured component" format that can be used with the EAT `Measurements` claim.

# Introduction

{{Section 4.2.16 of -rats-eat}} defines a `Measurements` claim that:

> "[c]ontains descriptions, lists, evidence or measurements of the software that exists on the entity or any other measurable subsystem of the entity."

This claim allows for different measurement formats, each identified by a different CoAP Content-Format ({{Section 12.3 of -coap}}).
Currently, the only specified format is CoSWID of type "evidence", as per {{Section 2.9.4 of -coswid}}.

This document introduces a "measured component" format that can be used with the EAT `Measurements` claim in addition to or as an alternative to CoSWID.

The term "measured component" refers to any measurable object on a target environment, that is, an object whose state can be sampled and digested.
This includes, for example: the invariant part of a firmware component that is loaded in memory at startup time, a run-time integrity check (RTIC), a file system object, or a CPU register.

# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

In this document, CDDL {{-cddl}} {{-cddlplus}} {{-cddlmod}} {{-cddlctls}} is used to describe the data formats.

# Information Model {#measured-component}

A "measured component" information element includes the digest of the component's sampled state along with metadata that helps in identifying the component.
Optionally, any entities responsible for signing the installed component can also be specified.

The information model of a "measured component" is described in {{tab-mc-info-elems}}.

| IE | Description | Requirement Level |
|----|-------------|-------------------|
| Component Name | The name given to the measured component. It is important that this name remains consistent across different releases to allow for better tracking of the same measured item across updates. When combined with a consistent versioning scheme, it enables better signaling from the appraisal procedure to the relying parties. | REQUIRED |
| Component Version | A value representing the specific release or development version of the measured component.  Using [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) is RECOMMENDED. | OPTIONAL |
| Digest Value | Hash of the measured component. | REQUIRED |
| Digest Algorithm | Hash algorithm used to compute the Digest Value. | REQUIRED |
| Signers | One or more unique identifiers of entities signing the measured component. | OPTIONAL |
{: #tab-mc-info-elems title="Measured Component Information Elements"}

# Data Model

The data model is inspired by the "PSA software component" claim ({{Section 4.4.1 of -psa-token}}), which has been refactored to take into account the recommendations about new EAT claims design in {{Appendix E of -rats-eat}}.

## CDDL

### The `measured-component` Data Item

~~~ cddl
{::include cddl/mc.cddl}
~~~

{:vspace}
`id`
: The measured component identifier encoded according to the format described in {{component-id}}.

`measurement`
: Digest value and algorithm, encoded using CoRIM digest format ({{Section 1.3.8 of -corim}}).

`signers`
: One or more signing entities, each encoded according to the format described in {{signer}}.

#### Component Identifier {#component-id}

~~~ cddl
{::include cddl/component-id.cddl}
~~~
{:vspace}

`name`
: A string that provides a human readable identifier for the component in question.  Format and adopted conventions depend on the component type.

`version`
: A compound `version` data item that reuses encoding and semantics of {{-rats-eat}} `sw-version-type`.

#### Signer {#signer}

A signer is the entity that digitally signs the measured component.
It could be an X.509 certificate, a raw public key, or public key thumprint.

The supported types are:

* Thumbprint of the signing public key using COSE Key Thumbprint {{-cose-key-thumbprint}}.

~~~ cddl
{::include cddl/signer.cddl}
~~~

### EAT `measurements-format` Extensions

The CDDL in {{fig-eat-plug}} extends the `$measurements-body-cbor` and `$measurements-body-json` EAT sockets to add support for `measured-component`s to the `Measurements` claim.

~~~ cddl
{::include cddl/eat-plug.cddl}
~~~
{: #fig-eat-plug title="EAT measurements-format Extensions"}

Each socket is extended with two new types: a "native" representation that is used when `measured-component` and the EAT have the same serialization (e.g., they are both CBOR), and a "tunnel" representation that is used when the serializations differ.

### `measurements-format` for CBOR EAT

The entries in {{tab-mf-cbor}} are the allowed `content-type` / `content-format` pairs when the `measured-component` is carried in a CBOR EAT.

Note the use of the "native" and "tunnel" formats from {{fig-eat-plug}}, and how the associated CoAP Content-Format is used to describe the original serialization.

| `content-type` (CoAP C-F equivalent) | `content-format` |
|--|--|
| `application/measured-component+cbor` | `mc-cbor` |
| `application/measured-component+json` | `tstr .b64u mc-json` |
{: #tab-mf-cbor title="measurement-format for EAT CWT"}

### `measurements-format` for JSON EAT

{{tab-mf-json}} is the equivalent of {{tab-mf-cbor}} for JSON-serialized EAT.

| `content-type` (CoAP C-F equivalent) | `content-format` |
|--|--|
| `application/measured-component+json` | `mc-json` |
| `application/measured-component+cbor` | `tstr .b64u mc-cbor` |
{: #tab-mf-json title="measurement-format for EAT JWT"}

# Examples

(The examples are CBOR only.
JSON examples will be added in a future version of this document.)

The example in {{ex-1}} is a measured component with all the fields populated.

~~~ cbor-edn
{::include cddl/ex1.diag}
~~~
{: #ex-1 title="Complete Measured Component"}

The example in {{ex-eat-1}} is the same measured component as above but used as the format of a `measurements` claim in a EAT claims-set.

Note that the example uses a CoAP Content-Format value from the experimental range (65000), which will change to the value assigned by IANA for the `application/measured-component+cbor` Content-Format.

Note also that the array contains only one measured component, but additional entries could be added if the measured TCB is made of multiple, individually measured components.
