1.  Introduction

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   In this document, CDDL [RFC8610] [RFC9165] is used to describe the
   data formats.

   The reader is assumed to be familiar with the vocabulary and concepts
   defined in [RFC9334].

5.  Implementation Status

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.  According to [RFC7942], "this will allow reviewers and
   working groups to assign due consideration to documents that have the
   benefit of running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable
   experimentation and feedback that have made the implemented protocols
   more mature.  It is up to the individual working groups to use this
   information as they see fit".

6.  IANA Considerations


   // RFC Editor: replace "RFCthis" with the RFC number assigned to this
   document.

6.1.  CWT measured-component Claim Registration

   IANA is requested to add a new measured-component claim to the "CBOR
   Web Token (CWT) Claims" registry [IANA.cwt] as follows:

   *  Claim Name: measured-component

   *  Claim Description: Measured Component

   *  Claim Key: TBD

   *  Claim Value Type(s): CBOR Map

   *  Change Controller: IETF

   *  Specification Document(s): Section 3 of RFCthis

   The suggested value for the Claim Key is TBD

6.2.  JWT measured-component Claim Registration

   IANA is requested to add a new measured-component claim to the "JSON
   Web Token Claims" sub-registry of the "JSON Web Token (JWT)" registry
   [IANA.jwt] as follows:

   *  Claim Name: measured-component

   *  Claim Description: Measured Component

   *  Claim Value Type(s): JSON object

   *  Change Controller: IETF

   *  Specification Document(s): Section 3 of RFCthis
