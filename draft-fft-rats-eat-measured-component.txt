1.  Introduction

   This document defines a EAT [I-D.ietf-rats-eat] claim to carry
   information about measured components.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   In this document, CDDL [RFC8610] [RFC9165] is used to describe the
   data formats.

   The reader is assumed to be familiar with the vocabulary and concepts
   defined in [RFC9334].

3.  Information Model

   A measured component information element includes the computed digest
   on the software or configuration payload, along with metadata that
   helps in identifying the measurement and the authorizing entity for
   component installation.

   Table 1 describes the information model of a measured component.

6.  IANA Considerations


   // RFC Editor: replace "RFCthis" with the RFC number assigned to this
   document.

6.1.  CWT measured-component Claim Registration

   IANA is requested to add a new measured-component claim to the "CBOR
   Web Token (CWT) Claims" registry [IANA.cwt] as follows:

   *  Claim Name: measured-component

   *  Claim Description: Measured Component

   *  Claim Key: TBD

   *  Claim Value Type(s): CBOR Map

   *  Change Controller: IETF

   *  Specification Document(s): Section 3 of RFCthis

   The suggested value for the Claim Key is TBD

6.2.  JWT measured-component Claim Registration

   IANA is requested to add a new measured-component claim to the "JSON
   Web Token Claims" sub-registry of the "JSON Web Token (JWT)" registry
   [IANA.jwt] as follows:

   *  Claim Name: measured-component

   *  Claim Description: Measured Component

   *  Claim Value Type(s): JSON object

   *  Change Controller: IETF

   *  Specification Document(s): Section 3 of RFCthis
