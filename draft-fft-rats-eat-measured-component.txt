1.  Introduction

   Section 4.2.16 of [I-D.ietf-rats-eat] defines a Measurements claim
   that:

      "[c]ontains descriptions, lists, evidence or measurements of the
      software that exists on the entity or any other measurable
      subsystem of the entity."

   This claim allows for different measurement formats, each identified
   by a different CoAP Content-Format (Section 12.3 of [RFC7252]).
   Initially, the only specified format is CoSWID of type "evidence", as
   per Section 2.9.4 of [RFC9393].

   This document introduces the "measured components" format that can be
   used with the EAT Measurements claim in addition or as an alternative
   to CoSWID.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   In this document, CDDL [RFC8610] [RFC9165]
   [I-D.ietf-cbor-cddl-modules] [I-D.ietf-cbor-cddl-more-control] is
   used to describe the data formats.

3.  Information Model

   A measured component information element includes the computed digest
   on the software or configuration payload, along with metadata that
   helps in identifying the measurement and the authorizing entity for
   component installation.

   Table 1 describes the information model of a measured component.

4.  Data Model

   The data model is inspired by the "PSA software component" claim
   (Section 4.4.1 of [I-D.tschofenig-rats-psa-token]), which has been
   slightly refactored to take into account the recommendations about
   new EAT claims design in Appendix E of [I-D.ietf-rats-eat].

   The following types and semantics have been reused:

   *  COSE Key Thumbprint [I-D.ietf-cose-key-thumbprint], for signer and
      countersigners;

   *  CoSWID software name and version [RFC9393], for component name and
      version;

   *  CoRIM digest [I-D.ietf-rats-corim], for digest value and
      algorithm.

4.1.  CDDL

   The measured-component data item:

   measured-component = [
     id:               component-id
     measurement:      corim.digest
     signer:           ckt
     ? countersigners: [ + ckt ]
   ]

   ; COSE Key Thumbprint
   ckt = bytes

   component-id = [
     name:      text
     ? version: version
   ]

   ;# import $version-scheme from rfc9393 as coswid

   version = [
     val:      text
     ? scheme: coswid.$version-scheme
   ]

   ; eventually: ";#import digest from rfcxxxx as corim"

   corim.digest = [
     alg: (int / text)
     val: bytes
   ]

   The CDDL extending the EAT Measurements format:

   $measurements-body-cbor /= bytes .cbor measured-component
   $measurements-body-json /= text .b64u measured-component

   $measurements-body-json /= text .json measured-component
   $measurements-body-cbor /= text .b64u measured-component

   (The examples are CBOR only.  JSON examples will be added in a future
   version of this document.)

   The example in Figure 1 is a measured component with all the fields
   populated.

     ]
   ]

                   Figure 1: Complete Measured Component

   The example in Figure 2 is the same measured component as above but
   used as the format of a measurements claim in a EAT claims-set.

   Note that the example uses a CoAP Content-Format value from the
   experimental range (65000), which will change to the value assigned
   by IANA for the application/measured-component+cbor Content-Format.

   Note also that the array contains only one measured component, but
   additional entries could be added if the measured TCB is made of
   multiple, individually measured components.
